</div>

<p>Mr. Punch is nothing if not typical of his fellow countrymen in his
interest in sport. If there be any truth in the assertion that
Englishmen are neglecting the more serious affairs of life in their
devotion to all forms of athletic sports, Mr. Punch would seem to be
determined that there shall be no lack of humour in the process; for an
immense proportion of his merry pages have been occupied with the humour
of sport.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no kind of open-air pastime which has escaped the
kindly attention of our national humorist, and the fact that he never
tires of poking good-natured fun at these hobbies of his countrymen,
making merry over their misadventures, indicates in some degree that,
whatever our social critics may think of the national taste for outdoor
games, these must have a humanising influence and make for manliness,
when their devotees can thus with good grace look upon themselves in Mr.
Punch's mirror, and join in the laughter at their own expense.</p>

<p>But it must not be assumed that Mr. Punch's attitude is one of satirical
criticism; on the contrary, his sympathies are with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> every form of
sportsmanship, and it is chiefly because his jovial knights of the
pencil delight to illustrate the mishaps incidental to all games that we
are entitled to look upon him as a great patron of our sports. And is
not he always ready to pillory the cad and the incompetent as further
proof of the soundness of his heart?</p>

<p>Certain volumes of this library are devoted entirely to one or other of
our popular pastimes, determined mainly on their varying richness in
humour, but in this "Book of Sports" we have brought together a
carefully chosen selection of Mr. Punch's wittiest sayings on a variety
of games and pastimes. Cricket might of itself have furnished forth a
volume, Football, and Racing also; but we have sought after variety
rather than repletion, and to this end even the passing craze for
Ping-pong has not been ignored, as it is not the least of the merits of
the Punch Library of Humour that within these volumes is enshrined a
comic chronicle of the passing time.</p>

<h2>THE LADY CRICKETER</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Directions for attaining Perfection.</em>)<br /><br /></p>

<p>Get up a match by saying to some local subaltern that it would be such
fun to have a game, and you know a girl who could give points to Grace.</p>

<p>Agree with the youthful warrior that the fun would be increased by
allowing the men to play with broom-sticks, and left-handed, and the
girls, of course, with bats, and unrestricted.</p>

<p>Arrange your eleven in such a fashion that you come out as captain in
the most picturesque costume.</p>

<p>Be careful to "kill" your colleagues' appearance by an artful
combination of discordant hues.</p>

<p>Carry out the above scheme with the assistance of a joint committee
consisting of two, yourself and the local subaltern.</p>

<p>Arrange, at the last moment, that the men shall only send out six of
their team to field.</p>

<p>Manage to put yourself in first, and play with confidence the initial
ball.</p>

<p>Amidst the applause of the six fielders you will be clean bowled.</p>

<p>Retire gracefully, and devote the rest of the afternoon to tea and mild
flirtation with the five men who have been weeded out.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="cite">Monsieur</span>,</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed with my gratitude to you and to the generous
dignitaries the Chancellors of your Universities, the Heads of your
great Public Seminaries, and the Principal of your renowned
Mary-le-bone College Club for the information they have given me
concerning "Le Criquette," your unique National game, and I thank
you in the name of my Committee for your present of
implements&mdash;<em>les wickettes</em>, <em>le boule de canon</em>, <em>les gros bois</em>
(the batsman's weapons), <em>le cuirasse pour les jambes de
Longstoppe</em>, and other necessaries for the dangers of the contest
that you have so kindly forwarded for our inspection. But most of
all are we indebted to you for sending over a 'ome team of your
brave professionals to play the match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> against our Parisian
"<em>onze</em>," for you rightly conjectured that by our experience of the
formidable game in action, we should be able to judge of its risks
and dangers, and after mature investigation be able so to revise
and ameliorate the manner of its playing as to bring it into
harmony with the taste and feeling of the athletic ambition of the
rising generation of our young France.</p>

<p>A Match has taken place, as you will see by "Le Score" subjoined,
which I enclose for your inspection. It was not without its fruits.
It disclosed to us, as you will remark by referring to "Le Score,"
very practically the dangerous, and I must add, the murderous
capabilities that "Le Cricquette" manifestly possesses. Our
Revising Committee has already the matter in hand, and when their
report is fully drawn up, I shall have much satisfaction in
forwarding it to you. Meantime, I must say that the substitution of
a light large ball of silk, or some other soft material for the
deadly "<em>boule de canon</em>" as used by your countrymen, has been
decided upon as absolutely necessary to deprive the game of
barbarism, and harmonise it with the instincts which Modern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Republican France associates with the pursuit of a harmless
pastime. <em>Les wickettes</em>, as being too small for the Bowlsman to
reach them, should be raised to six feet high, and the Umpire, a
grave anomaly in a game cherished by a liberty-loving people,
should be instantly suppressed. The "overre," too, should consist
of sixteen balls. But this and many other matters are under the
consideration of the Committee. I now subjoin "Le Score" I
mentioned; a brief perusal of it will show you what excellent
grounds the Committee have for making the humanising alterations at
which I have hinted.</p>

<p>So the game stood at the end of the fifth day, when, spite all the
efforts of "All France," even the putting on of three "Bowlsmen" at
once, it was found impossible to take even one of the "'Ome-team"
<em>wickettes</em>. Yet the contest was maintained by the "Outside" with
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> wonderful heroism and <em>élan</em>, for though by degrees, in nobly
attempting to stop the flight of the <em>boule de canon</em> as it sped on
its murderous course, driven by the furious and savage blows of the
batsmen in all directions over the field, the fieldsmen, one by
one, struck in the arms, legs, head and back, began to grow feeble
under their unceasing blows and contusions, still one and all from
the "Long-leg-off" to the indomitable "Longstoppe," faced the
dangers of their situation with a proud smile, indicative of the
noble calm of an admirable spirit. So, Monsieur, the game, which
was not finished, and which, in consequence, the Umpire, with a
chivalrous generosity, announced as "drawn," came to its
conclusion. You will understand, from the perusal of the above, the
direction in which my Committee will be likely to modify the rules
of the game, and simplify the apparatus for playing it, so as to
give your "Cricquette" a chance of finding itself permanently
acclimatised in this country.</p>

<p>Accept, Monsieur, the assurance of my most distinguished
consideration,</p>

<h2>THE LADY CRICKETER'S GUIDE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="cite">Bowling.</span></p>

<p>1. Should you desire to bowl leg-breaks, close the right eye.</p>

<p>2. Off-breaks are obtained by closing the left eye.</p>

<p>3. To bowl straight, close both.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="cite">Batting.</span></p>

<p>1. Don't be afraid to leave the "popping" crease&mdash;there is another at
the other end.</p>

<p>2. County cricketers use the curved side of the bat for driving.</p>

<p>3. A "leg glance" is not football.</p>

<p>4. When "over" is called, don't cross the wicket.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="cite">Fielding.</span></p>

<p>1. Stop the ball with your feet. If you are unable to find it, step on
one side.</p>

<p>2. To catch a ball, sit down gracefully and wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>3. When throwing in from the country, aim half-way up the pitch; you may
then hit one of the wickets&mdash;which one I don't know.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Postscript.</em></p>

<p>The spirit in which the game should be played is best shown by the
following extract from the <em>Leicester Daily Mercury</em>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="cite">Barrow Ladies</span> <em>v.</em> <span class="cite">Thrussington Ladies</span>.</p>

<p>"Barrow went in first, but were dismissed for sixteen. Only three
Thrussington ladies batted, owing to the Barrow team refusing to
field, because the umpire gave Miss Reid in for an appeal for run
out."</p></blockquote>

<p class="i2">To console you by remarking that defeat is not disgrace.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For you doubtless find flirtation at this pleasant occupation</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO YOUNG CROQUET-PLAYERS</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_082a.png" width="150" alt="Tennis player." />
</div>

<p>1. Always take your own mallet to a garden party. This will impress
everyone with the idea that you are a fine player. Or an alternative
plan is to play with one provided by your host, and then throughout the
game to attribute every bad stroke to the fact that you have not your
own implement with you.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_082b.png" width="150"  alt="Tennis player." />
</div>

<p>2. Use as many technical terms as you can, eking them out with a few
borrowed from golf. Thus it will always impress your partner if you say
that you are "stimied," especially as she won't know what it means. But
a carefully-nurtured reputation may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> destroyed at once if you confuse
"roquet" with "croquet," so be very careful that you get these words
right.</p>

<p>3. Aim for at least three minutes before striking the ball, and appear
overcome with amazement when you miss. If you have done so many times in
succession, it may be well to remark on the unevenness of the ground. If
you hit a ball by mistake always pretend that you aimed at it.</p>

<p>4. It is a great point to give your partner advice in a loud and
authoritative tone&mdash;it doesn't matter in the least whether it is
feasible or not. Something like the following, said very quickly, always
sounds well:&mdash;"Hit one red, take two off him and make your hoop; send
two red towards me and get into position." In a game of croquet there is
always one on each side who gives advice, and one who receives (and
disregards) it. All the lookers-on naturally regard the former as the
finer player, therefore begin giving advice on your partner's first
stroke. If she happens to be a good player this may annoy her, but that
is no consequence.</p>

<p>5. Remember that "a mallet's length from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> boundary" varies
considerably. If you play next, it means three yards, if your opponent
does so, it means three inches. So, too, with the other "rules," which
no one really knows. When in an awkward position, the best course is to
invent a new rule on the spur of the moment, and to allege (which will
be perfectly true) that "it has just been introduced."</p>

<p>6. Much may be done by giving your ball a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> gentle kick when the backs of
the other players happen to be turned. Many an apparently hopeless game
has been saved by this method. Leave your conscience behind when you
come to a croquet-party.</p>

<h2>THE WOOING</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[The sporting instinct is now so keen among girls that a man who
gallantly moderates his hitting in mixed hockey is merely regarded
as an <em>incapable slacker</em> by his fair opponents.]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem w26"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">When first I played hockey with Kitty,</p>
<p class="i2">I was right off my usual game,</p>
<p class="i0">For she looked so bewitchingly pretty</p>
<p class="i2">When straight for the circle she came;</p>
<p class="i0">As a rule I'm not backward, or chary,</p>
<p class="i2">Of hitting and harassing too,</p>
<p class="i0">But who can be rough with a fairy&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Not I&mdash;so I let her go through.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">She scored, and we couldn't get equal;</p>
<p class="i2">The others all thought me a fool,</p>
<p class="i0">And Kitty herself, in the sequel,</p>
<p class="i2">Grew most unexpectedly cool.</p>
<p class="i0">They gave us a licking, as stated,</p>
<p class="i2">I was sick at the sight of the ball,</p>
<p class="i0">She thought me a lot over-rated,</p>
<p class="i2">And wondered they played me at all.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But she frankly approved Percy Waters,</p>
<p class="i2">Who uses his stick like a flail,</p>
<p class="i0">And always impartially slaughters</p>
<p class="i2">Both sexes, the strong and the frail;</p>
<p class="i0">A mutual friendliness followed,</p>
<p class="i2">I watched its career with dismay&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">Next match-day my feelings I swallowed.</p>
<p class="i2">And hit in my orthodox way.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I caught her a crunch on the knuckle,</p>
<p class="i2">A clip on the knee and the cheek,</p>
<p class="i0">She said, with a rapturous chuckle,</p>
<p class="i2">"I see&mdash;you weren't trying last week."</p>
<p class="i0">Such conduct its cruelty loses</p>
<p class="i2">When it brings consolation to both,</p>
<p class="i0">For after she'd counted her bruises</p>
<p class="i2">That evening we plighted our troth.</p>

<h2>THE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY</h2>

<div class="poem w26"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">I saw an aged, aged man</p>
<p class="i4">One morning near the Row,</p>
<p class="i2">Who sat, dejected and forlorn,</p>
<p class="i4">Till it was time to go.</p>
<p class="i0">It made me quite depressed and bad</p>
<p class="i0">To see a man so wholly sad&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">I went and told him so.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">I asked him why he sat and stared</p>
<p class="i4">At all the passers-by,</p>
<p class="i2">And why on ladies young and fair</p>
<p class="i4">He turned his watery eye.</p>
<p class="i0">He looked at me without a word,</p>
<p class="i0">And then&mdash;it really was absurd&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">The man began to cry.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">But when his rugged sobs were stayed&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">It made my heart rejoice&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">He said that of the young and fair</p>
<p class="i4">He sought to make a choice.</p>
<p class="i0">He was an artist, it appeared&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">I might have guessed it by his beard,</p>
<p class="i4">Or by his gurgling voice.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">His aim in life was to procure</p>
<p class="i4">A model fit to paint</p>
<p class="i2">As "Beauty on a Pedestal,"</p>
<p class="i4">Or "Figure of a Saint."</p>
<p class="i0">But every woman seemed to be</p>
<p class="i0">As crooked as a willow tree&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">His metaphors were quaint.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"And have you not observed," he asked,</p>
<p class="i4">"That all the girls you meet</p>
<p class="i2">Have either 'Hockey elbows' or</p>
<p class="i4">Ungainly 'Cycling feet'?</p>
<p class="i0">Their backs are bent, their faces red,</p>
<p class="i0">From 'Cricket stoop,' or 'Football head.'"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<p class="i4">He spoke to me with heat.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"But have you never found," I said,</p>
<p class="i4">"Some girl without a fault?</p>
<p class="i2">Are all the women in the world</p>
<p class="i4">Misshapen, lame or halt?"</p>
<p class="i0">He gazed at me with eyes aglow,</p>
<p class="i0">And, though the tears had ceased to flow,</p>
<p class="i4">His beard was fringed with salt.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"There was a day, I mind it well,</p>
<p class="i4">A lady passed me by</p>
<p class="i2">In whose physique my searching glance</p>
<p class="i4">No blemish could descry.</p>
<p class="i0">I followed her at headlong pace,</p>
<p class="i0">But when I saw her, face to face,</p>
<p class="i4"><em>She had the</em> '<em>Billiard eye'</em>!"</p>

<h2>MIXED HOCKEY</h2>

<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">You came down the field like a shaft from a bow</p>
<p class="i2">The vision remains with me yet.</p>
<p class="i0">I hastened to check you: the sequel you know:</p>
<p class="i2">Alas! we unluckily met.</p>
<p class="i0">You rushed at the ball, whirled your stick like a flail,</p>
<p class="i2">And you hit with the vigour of two:</p>
<p class="i0">A knight in his armour had surely turned pale,</p>
<p class="i2">If he had played hockey with you.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">They gathered me up, and they took me to bed:</p>
<p class="i2">They called for a doctor and lint:</p>
<p class="i0">With ice in a bag they enveloped my head;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<p class="i2">My arm they enclosed in a splint.</p>
<p class="i0">My ankles are swelled to a terrible size;</p>
<p class="i2">My shins are a wonderful blue;</p>
<p class="i0">I have lain here a cripple, unable to rise,</p>
<p class="i2">Since the day I played hockey with you.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Yet still, in the cloud hanging o'er me so black,</p>
<p class="i2">A silvery lining I spy:</p>
<p class="i0">A man who's unhappily laid on his back</p>
<p class="i2">Can yet have a solace. May I?</p>
<p class="i0">An angel is woman in moments of pain,</p>
<p class="i2">Sang Scott: clever poet, <em>he</em> knew:</p>
<p class="i0">It may, I perceive, be distinctly a gain</p>
<p class="i2">To have fallen at hockey with you.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For if you'll but nurse me (Come quickly, come now),</p>
<p class="i2">If you'll but administer balm,</p>
<p class="i0">And press at my bidding my feverish brow</p>
<p class="i2">With a cool but affectionate palm;</p>
<p class="i0">If you'll sit by my side, it is possible, quite,</p>
<p class="i2">That I may be induced to review</p>
<p class="i0">With a feeling more nearly akin to delight</p>
<p class="i2">That day I played hockey with you.</p>

<h2>"LE FOOTE-BALLE"</h2>

<p class="center"><em>Offices of the Athletic Convention, Paris.</em></p>

<p><span class="cite">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Having already expressed my views as to the capabilities
possessed by "Le Cricquette" for becoming a national game worthy the
attention of the young sporting gentlemen of our modern France, I now
turn me to the consideration of your "Foote-Balle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>I have examined the apparatus for the play you have so kindly sent
over,&mdash;the great leathern bag of wind which is kicked, "<em>les</em>
Goalpoles," and the regulations for the playing of the game, and have
seen your fifteen professional County "kicksmen" engage,&mdash;I shudder as I
recall the terrible sight,&mdash;in a contest, horrible, murderous, and
demoniacal, with an equal number of my unhappy compatriots, alas! in
their enthusiasm and <em>élan</em>, ignorant of the deadly struggle that
awaited them in the game in which they were about innocently to join. To
witness the savage rush of your professional kicksmen was terrifying,
and when, in displaying "<em>le scrimmage</em>, they scattered, with the
kicks of their legs, my fainting compatriots, who fell lamed and wounded
in all directions, I said to myself, this "Foote-Balle" is not a
pastime, it is an encounter of wild beasts, "<em>un vrai carnage</em>," fit to
be played, not by civilised sporting gentlemen, but by cannibals.</p>

<p>But let me explain that it is not the kick to which I object, for is not
<em>le coup de pied</em> the national defence of France? Indeed, in your own
fist contest in "Le Boxe-Match," is not to deliver a kick in the jaw of
your antagonist considered a meritorious <em>coup</em>, showing great skill in
the boxe-man? And do not our own <em>garçons de collège</em> kick a <em>confrère</em>
when he is "down," and point to the circumstance with a legitimate pride
and satisfaction? No, it is not <em>le coup de pied</em> which makes horrible
"Le Foote-Balle," but the conspiracy organised of the kicksmen&mdash;<em>Les
Demidos</em> (the 'alf-backs), <em>Les En Avants</em> (the Forwards), and the
"Goal-keepers"&mdash;all to kick the leathern bag of wind at once, and so
produce a murderous <em>mêlée</em> in which arms, legs, ribs, thighs, necks,
and spines are all broken together, and may be heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> simultaneously
cracking by any of the terror-struck but helpless spectators who are
watching the ghastly contest.</p>

<p>Viewing the game under this aspect, you will not be surprised to hear
that my Committee have, as they did in dealing with "Le Cricquette,"
revised the rules and regulations for the playing of your "Foote-Balle,"
so as to suit it to the tastes and requirements of the rising generation
of our Modern France. I cannot at present furnish you with full details
of the suggested modifications, but I may inform you that it has been
unanimously decided that the "Balle," which is to be of "some light,
airy, floating material, and three times its present size," is not to be
touched by the foot at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> all, but struck lightly by the palm of the hand,
and thus wafted harmlessly, with a smart smack, over the heads of the
combatants.</p>

<p>As to costume, the game is to be played in white satin bed-room
slippers, with (as a protection in the event, spite every possible
precaution, of "<em>le scrimmage</em>" arising) feather pillows strapped over
the knees and chest. It is calculated by our Committee that the savage
proclivities of the game, as fostered by the terrible rules of your
murderous "Rugby Association," will be thus, in some measure,
counteracted.</p>

<p>Hoping soon to hear from you on the subject of your <em>Courses d'Eau</em>, as
I shall doubtless have some suggestions to make in reference to the
conduct of your aquatic contests, receive, Monsieur, the assurance of my
most distinguished consideration,</p>

<h2>OPEN LETTER TO A PAIR OF FOOTBALL BOOTS</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>With acknowledgments to Mr. C. B. Fry in the "Daily Express"</em>)</p>

<p><span class="cite">Dear old Pals</span>,&mdash;I want to speak to you seriously and as man to man,
because you're not mere dead hide, are you? No, no, you are intelligent,
sentient soles, and to be treated as such by every player.</p>

<p>Ah! booties, booties, you little beauties, what a lot you mean to us,
don't you? and how hardly we use you.</p>

<p>I've known men to take you off after a game, hurl you&mdash;as Jove hurled
his thunderbolts&mdash;into a corner of the pav. and there leave you till you
are next required.</p>

<p>Ah! old men, that's not right, is it? How would we great machines of
bone, muscle, and nerve-centre (ah! those nerve-centres, what tricky
things they are!), how would we be for the next match if we were treated
like that? Pretty stiff and stale, eh, old booties?</p>

<p>Now, look here, when we come in after a hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> slogging game, our bodies
and the grey matter in our brains thoroughly exhausted, immediately
we've had our bath, our rub-down, and our cup of steaming hot Hercubos
(I find Hercubos the finest thing to keep fit on during a hard season)
we must turn our attention to you, booties.</p>

<p>First, out from our little bag must come our piece of clean, sweet
selvyt. With it all that nasty black slime that gets into your pores and
makes you crack must be wiped off. Now, before a good blazing fire of
coal&mdash;not coke, mind, the fumes of a coke fire pale and de-oxygenate the
red corpuscles of our blood, you know&mdash;we must carefully warm you till
you are ripe to receive a real good dousing of our Porpo (I find Porpo
the finest thing for keeping boots soft and pliable).</p>

<p>Finally, with a white silk handkerchief we must give you a soft
polishing, and there you are, sweet and trim against our next match.
Every morning you may be sure we will, like Boreas, drive away the
clouds of dust that collect on you.</p>

<p>And then there are the laces to attend to. Oh, yes, your laces are like
our nerve-fibres, the little threads that keep the whole big body taut
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> sound. They, too, must have a good rubbing of Porpo and a rest if
they need it.</p>

<p>Ah! and won't you repay our trouble, booties, when next we slip you on?
How tightly you will clasp us just above the tubercles of our tibiæ, how
firmly you will grip our pliant toes, how you will help us to send the
ball swishing&mdash;low and swift&mdash;into the well-tarred net!</p>

<p>Good-night, booties.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Going to Epsom?</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> No, I think not. Fact is, the place gets duller year by year.
The train has knocked the fun out of the road.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Such a waste of time. Why go in a crowd to see some horses
race, when you can read all about it in the evening papers?</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Just so. No fun. No excitement. And the Downs are wretched if
it rains or snows.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Certainly. The luncheon, too, is all very well; but, after all,
it spoils one's dinner.</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Distinctly. And champagne at two o'clock is premature.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> And lobster-salad undoubtedly indigestible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> So it's much
better not to go to the Derby&mdash;in spite of the luncheon.</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Yes,&mdash;in spite of the luncheon.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Hullo! You here?</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Hullo! And if it comes to that, you here, too?</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Well, I really found so little doing in town that I thought I
might be here as well as anywhere else.</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> Just my case. Not that there's much to see or do. Silly as
usual.</p>

<p><em>Jones.</em> Quite. Always said the Derby was a fraud. But I am afraid, my
dear fellow, I must hurry away, as I have got to get back to my party
for luncheon.</p>

<p><em>Brown.</em> So have I.</p>

<p>Take great care in purchasing a really good colt. Don't let expense
stand in your way, but be sure you get for money money's worth.</p>

<p>Obtain the most experienced trainer in the market, and confide your colt
to his care. But, at the same time, let him have the advantage of your
personal encouragement and the opinion of those of your sporting friends
upon whose judgment you can place reliance.</p>

<p>When the day of the great race draws near, secure the most reliable
jockey and every other advantage that you can obtain for your valuable
animal.</p>

<p>Then, having taken every precaution to win the Derby, why&mdash;win it!</p>
